# 2021 NFL losers pool
The objective of the competition is to pick one team to lose each week. If your team wins, you are out of the pool. Last man standing wins.  
This is an attempt at optimizing the [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nfl-predictions/) predictions for the losers pool.  
The `NFL-losers-pool-2021.md` file is best to view to see my analysis.
